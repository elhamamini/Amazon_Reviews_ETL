## Overview
#### Abstract
The team has been tasked to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

The intent of this analysis is to determine if there is bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in this dataset.
